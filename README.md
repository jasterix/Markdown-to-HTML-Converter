# NPM-crash-course
 Notes from Traversy crash course

## Background
This project originally started as a simple app to practice working with NPM.

I took some notes with the Bear app. But the option to convert to HTML was behind a paywall. And so what was a basic nothing app turned into a tool for converting my markdown notes to HTML. 

Thanks to this fantastic [blog post](https://www.devextent.com/convert-markdown-to-html-nodejs/) by James Edwards, I was able to do that in a few hours.

## Technologies
- typescript
- markdown-it
- highlight.js
- fs-extra
- live-server (instead of http server)
- babel

## Experience
This was my first time working with markdown-it and highlight.js. These two modules did most of the heavy lifting for this app. I'm excited to see what else I can use them for.

## Functionality
- [x] Convert markdown document to HTML
- [x] Render HTML in browser with live-server
- [ ] Pass file path(s) as an input
- [ ] Convert to Word doc
- [ ] Convert to PDF
